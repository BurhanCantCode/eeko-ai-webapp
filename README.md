This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Ahsen Tahir : 
Explored complex data from the website and found the power API data for LLM integration. Additionally, I reviewed research papers for implementation and initially tried Roboflow's weed detection model. When it didnâ€™t work, I switched to fine-tuning YOLOv5 with Mohib's help for UI integration using FastAPI.
